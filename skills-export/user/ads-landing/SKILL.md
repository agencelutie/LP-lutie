# Landing Page Quality for Ad Campaigns

## Process

1. Collect landing page URLs from active ad campaigns
2. Assess each landing page for ad-specific quality factors
3. Score landing pages and identify improvement opportunities
4. Generate recommendations prioritized by conversion impact

## Message Match Assessment

The #1 landing page issue in ad campaigns — does the page match the ad?

### What to Check

- **Headline match**: landing page H1 reflects ad copy headline/keyword
- **Offer match**: promoted offer (price, discount, trial) is visible above fold
- **CTA match**: landing page CTA matches ad's promised action
- **Visual match**: consistent imagery between ad creative and page
- **Keyword match**: search keyword appears naturally in page content

### Message Match Scoring

| Level | Description | Score |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Exact match | Headline, offer, CTA all align perfectly | 100% |
| Partial match | Headline matches but offer/CTA differs | 60% |
| Weak match | Generic page, loosely related to ad | 30% |
| Mismatch | Page content doesn't reflect ad promise | 0% |

## Page Speed Assessment

Slow pages kill conversion rates. For every 1s delay, CVR drops ~7%.

### Thresholds (Ad Landing Pages)

| Metric | Pass | Warning | Fail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| LCP | <2.5s | 2.5-4.0s | >4.0s |
| FID/INP | <100ms | 100-200ms | >200ms |
| CLS | <0.1 | 0.1-0.25 | >0.25 |
| Time to Interactive | <3.0s | 3.0-5.0s | >5.0s |
| Page weight | <2MB | 2-5MB | >5MB |

## Mobile Experience

75%+ of ad clicks come from mobile. Mobile experience is critical.

### Mobile Checklist

- Tap targets: ≥48x48px with ≥8px spacing
- Font size: ≥16px body text (no pinch-to-zoom needed)
- Form fields: properly sized, keyboard type matches input
- CTA button: full-width on mobile, visible without scrolling
- No horizontal scroll
- Phone number clickable (tel: link)

## Trust Signals

### Above-the-Fold Trust Elements

- Company logo visible
- Social proof (customer count, reviews, ratings)
- Security badges (SSL, payment security, guarantees)
- Recognizable client logos (B2B)
- Star ratings or testimonial snippet

## Form Optimization

### Form Length Impact on CVR

| Fields | Expected CVR Impact | Use Case |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1-3 fields | Highest CVR | Top-of-funnel, free offer |
| 4-5 fields | Moderate CVR | Mid-funnel, qualified leads |
| 6-8 fields | Lower CVR | Bottom-funnel, sales-ready |
| 9+ fields | Lowest CVR | Only for high-value offers |

### Form Best Practices

- Pre-fill fields where possible (UTM data, known info)
- Use multi-step forms for 5+ fields (progressive disclosure)
- Inline validation (don't wait until submit to show errors)
- Submit button text is specific ("Get My Free Quote" not "Submit")
- Thank you page has clear next steps
